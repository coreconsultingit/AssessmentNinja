Performance counters are counters or they are measures of events in a software which allows us to do analysis. These counters are installed when software is installed. So we can use counters like GC Heap size , GC0 , GC1 , GC2 and working set to make more sense of how GC is working.", "Does Garbage collector clean primitive types ?": "No , Garbage collector does not clean primitive types. They are allocated on stack and stack removes them as soon as the variables goes out of scope.", "Question 131: - Managed vs UnManaged code /objects/resources ?": "Managed resources are those which are pure .NET objects  and these objects are controller by .NET CLR .

Fiddling with GC is not recommended at all.", "How can we detect a memory issues  ?": "Memory issues can be detected by running tools like Visual studio profiler. And we can check for two things: - \u2022 If the memory is increasing linearly it\u2019s a indication of memory issues. If the memory is moving in a range it\u2019s a healthy sign. \u2022 Also the memory allocation and deallocation should be balanced. If you just see memory allocation and no deallocation is other sign that there is serious memory issues.", "How can we know the exact  source of memory issues ?": "In profiler we should check for the top most memory allocated  to objects.  Once we know the top most memory allocated  to objects we can then focus on code around those objects.", "What is a memory leak ?": "Memory leak is a situation where the memory consumed by the application is not returned back to the operating system when the application exits.", "Question 147: - Can .NET Application have memory leak as we have GC  ?": "Yes its still possible to have memory leaks because GC only takes care of managed memory. If unmanaged memory is not claimed properly we can have memory leaks.", "How to detect memory leaks  in .NET applications  ?": "Total memory of .NET app = Unmanaged + Managed. So, if you see just see total memory  is increasing and managed is in a range then it means there  is Unmanaged leak.", "Explain weak and strong references ?": "Weak reference: - It permits the GC to collect the object but still allows to access the object until GC collects the object.  We need to use the \u201cWeakReference\u201d object to create weak reference. Strong reference: - This is a normal reference d objects and once object is marked for GC it can never be referenced.", "When will you use weak references ?": "Caching , Object pooling . Wherever object  creation process is resource intensive caching and pooling can improve performance.", "Question 151: - What are design patterns?": "Design patterns are time tested solution for recurring architecture problems. Also, with the above definition try to give one or two design patterns as examples. While giving examples remember three things: - 1. Do not give example of Singleton pattern so that you can stand out in the crowd. 2. Give one example of non -GOF pattern like repository, CQRS and so on. 3. And whatever patterns you say in example make sure you are fully aware of the same. Examples of pattern please tailor as per your knowledge \u201cPrototype\u201d   helps to fully initialize instance to be copied or cloned \u201cAdapter pattern\u201d helps to make incompatible interfaces compatible. \u201cIterator pattern\u201d helps iterate over elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the object. \u201cTemplate pattern\u201d define a skeleton of the algorithm in parent class and let subclass override specific steps. \u201cRepository pattern\u201d helps to abstract and centralize the data access logic in an application. It provides a layer of separation between the application's business logic and the data access code, making the code more modular, maintainable, and testable.", "Question 152 : - Which are the different types of design patterns?": "", "Question 153 : - Explain structural , Behavioral and Creational design": "pattern ? There are 3 categories of design pattern: - \u2022 Creational: - Problems and solutions around object creation issues. o Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned o Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist \u2022 Behavioral: - Problems and solutions around Communication between objects. o Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects o Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object o Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes o Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state o Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass \u2022 Structural: - Solving concerns around class structure and object composition. o Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes o Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects o Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically", "Question 154 : - Which design pattern have you used in your project?": "Note: - first and foremost do not answer SINGLETON pattern as it will not help you stand in the crowd. and remember: - \u2022 My choice of patterns is not yours so pick what you are comfortable. \u2022 Only talk about patterns you are confident of. Many patterns you have already used in your projects. If you can have closer look on them you can speak not only confidently but also naturally. When answers are natural interviewers love it. \u2022 Do not just talk GOF but also talk about Non -GOF patterns. \u2022 Yes, avoid singleton stand in the crowd. Its over used and abused in interviews. Some of the most used patterns are: - Most of the applications are CRUD so repository pattern comes at the top. Repository pattern: - Acts like an abstract layer between Models and Data access technologies like EF, ADO.NET and so on. Data access logic is centralized making code maintainable, testable and modular. With repository pattern, UOW goes like hand in gloves. UOW (Unit of work): - This pattern helps to manage transactions and changes made to objects. It goes with repository pattern well. We all know we use FOR EACH so much so the next pattern is also very must used. One important point to note here talk about IEnumerator and IEnumerable as they implement iterator by default. Iterator pattern: - helps iterate over elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the object . Factory pattern: - From creational pattern this is the most used one. Creates an instance of several derived classes. Used when third party components are used. Adapter pattern : - Makes incompatible interfaces compatible. Decorator pattern : - Add behavior dynamically. Command pattern: - Treat command as objects. Heavy use in CQRS Fa\u00e7ade : - Represent subsystem in a simplified way. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass", "Question 154 : - Explain Singleton Pattern and the use of the same?": "Singleton pattern helps to create a single instance of an object. Some of the uses of Singleton patterns are: - \u2022 Caching of data like Countries, States, Currencies and so on. \u2022 Global sharing of data like common themes , hit counters and so on.", "Question 155 : - How did you implement singleton pattern?": "To implement singleton pattern (Check the number with the above figure): - 1. Whole part relationship: - The first thing needed in singleton is a root class through which all shared objects should be exposed. This root class instance should be created inside the class and it should be static. 2. Thread safety: - Whenever we are loading the singleton object use the \u201clock\u201d keyword to make sure only one thread manipulates at a time. 3. Private constructor: - Make sure the root class can not be instantiated from outside. 4. Ensure root object is single instance: - use the double null check and make sure that only one instance is created and also lock is not executed unnecessarily. 5.

Performance for threading: - NULL check before the locking to ensure that we do not execute locks unnecessarily.", "Question 156 : - Can we use Static class rather than using a private": "constructor?", "Question 157: -  Static vs Singleton pattern?": "Let\u2019s answer both the questions in One Go. \u2022 Keyword VS Design Pattern: - Static is a language keyword while Singleton is a Design pattern. \u2022 Loose many OOP features: - If you make a class static you cannot implement interfaces, cannot inherit and so on. \u2022 Lazy loading / Thread Safety: - When you make a class static, object is created in the first call itself without giving you option of when to load and when not. Second you should also make sure its thread safe as it\u2019s a global object.", "Question 158: - How did you implement thread safety in Singleton?": "C# \u201clock\u201d keyword helps to implement thread safety.

Internal null check : - This is done to make sure the instance load only once and its loaded OnDemand. External null check  :- This is done so that \u201clock\u201d is not acquired unnecessarily. \u201clock\u201d is an intensive process and should be executed only when the singleton is null.", "Question 160: -Can Singleton pattern code be made easy with Lazy": "keyword? Yes, by using LAZY keyword we can make the code size smaller.

Repository pattern helps to abstract  and centralize  the data access logic thus providing a clean and consistent interface for CRUD operation on models.", "Question 163: -Is Dal  (Data  access Layer)  and Repository same?": "Note: - In interviews for repositories do not use vocabulary Dal interchangeably,  it can send a different impression to the interviewer. Dal focuses on the technical details of data access while repository pattern provides a higher level of abstraction over Dal.  Dal provides technical centric approach  of how to access the data source,  while Repositories provide Domain centric approach.", "Question 164: -What is Generic repository pattern ?": "Generic repository pattern is an extension to repository pattern. Rather than creating separate interfaces / classes for each entity,  you can just create a generic interface / class for all entities.", "Question 165: -Is abstraction the only benefit of Repository?": "Note: - I framed this question on purpose as this can be a part of discussion more than a question. During this discussion the interviewer is expecting that reusability  is also another big benefit of Repository other than loose coupling. The other benefit of repository pattern is reusability across data access layers. There can be many logic which is common across data layers and they can be put in a common class and all repositories would inherit from that common class.", "Question 166: -How to implement transaction in repository?": "Note: - In this question the interviewer is expecting you should know  Unit of work design pattern which is answered in the next question.", "Question 167: -What is Unit of work design pattern ?": "Unit of Work ( UOW ) helps to  abstract /  implement transactions in repository. Note : - Many developers do not know how to answer transaction  definition  so here is the answer : - Transaction is a group of task / operation where in either the whole group is committed or  the whole group is rolled back.", "Question 168: -Do we need repository pattern as EF does almost the": "same work? Note: - This question  cannot be answered in black and white,  it\u2019s a subjective question and interviewers can have their own perspective.   So, the challenge is if you do not answer from interviewer \u2019s perspective, he will feel uncomfortable and  on the other hand there  can be interviewers who would like to get in to intellectual discussion  and understand that do you know both  the perspectives . Perspective 1 : - Repository pattern is a must The first  school of thought believes in best practices  like loose coupling and unit testing. They understand  the importance of repository pattern that it  helps to abstract the Data access layer (Heterogenous  data sources)  so that we can change /  use different  DAL technologi es (EF , Dapper , ADONET etc.) with ease. If you are using multiple DAL technologies  (heterogenous  data sources)  and you want plug and play of DAL in future,  repository is a MUST. Second reason this school  also thinks  that unit testing  is important . Which again is a very compelling reason you need to have a repository so that you can mock test it easily . Perspective 2 :- EF implements Repository not needed Myth: - Many developers  from this school think that EF implements repository pattern. But that\u2019s not true. Repository helps you to only abstract RDBMS data source and not other data sources (File  , API and so on) .  Repository pattern abstracts across Heterogenous data access technologies. But if you are only dealing with heterogenous  RDBMS then I personally  feel repository pattern is overkill. Also let\u2019s  try to visualize the same in a picture format. Repository\u2019s main goal is to provide abstraction over heterogenous data sources while EF is ORM which provides abstraction over heterogenous RDBMS sources. Now summing the answer from interview perspective. Comparison of Repository pattern with EF is like comparing apples  with oranges because one is Data access technology while other is a design pattern which focuses on abstraction over heterogenous data access technologies. As a good practice it\u2019s always good to use Repository pattern as it creates a higher level of abstraction over any kind of data source and also makes MOCK UNIT TESTING  easy to implement. After this watch the interviewers reaction if you think he belongs to the second school  and if he is having an ANTI - REPOSITORY mind set then you can just say \u201cYes , I do agree if we do not have heterogenous data sources  repository pattern can be overkill\u201d . Note : - One of the key to success during interview is \u201c Satisfying the interviewer that  he is RIGHT  (The EGO)  \u201d. That releases a chemical called as dopamine which make him feel good and that can be affect your interview results in a very positive way.", "Question 169: -Did you do unit testing with Repository  ?": "", "Question 170: -How does repository pattern make unit testing easy?": "", "Question 171: -How can we do mock testing with Repository?": "Note: - All the above flavor of questions  stresses the importance of unit testing  and mock testing in repository . Interviewer would like to know that do you understand the importance of unit testing in repository. Repository pattern is a higher level of abstraction over  Data access logic. And this Abstraction is represented by EMPTY  GENERIC  INTERFACE.  Because of this generic Interface s unit testing is like a cake walk . The ONE big benefit of doing unit testing on Empty interface is ISOLATED MOCK UNIT Testing.  Mock Unit testing has two primary uses: - \u2022 Unit testing by passing Data access Logic: - Many times you want to only test business logic and not the data access part. With repository this is like a cake walk. \u2022 Parallel Development and Testing: - Many time s data access is developed by some other team , so either they have not completed the code or are in between and you want to still test your part of the code  , repository is the answer for it. private bool FakeSave(){ // Do nothing just by pass return true; } var mockRepo  = new Mock<IRepository<Customer>>(); // create the fake object with fake method mockRepo.Setup(x => x.Save()).Returns(FakeSave());"}
